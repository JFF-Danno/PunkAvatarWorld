White Paper WIP



**Title: Punk Avatar World - Making NFTs Fun**

**Abstract:**

This white paper outlines the vision, mission, and strategic approach will undertake.

**1. Introduction:**
PFP NFTs were massively popular and succsseful in the previous crypto bullrun. Much like crypto, NFTs have been declared dead. That tells us in nft twitter to get ready for round 2.
This whitepaper delves into our intended approach to capitilizing on the growth of NFTs utilizing pfps with  social gaming experiences.

**2. Vision and Mission:**
Our vision is to extend the scope of your social media pfp by allowing you to use it in our free to play social metaverse experience wtih countless board and table games and opportunities for social interactions.
At the same time we'll be onboarding new communities and linking up with existing ones to add their universe to ours.

**3. Punk Avatar Creator Labs:**
We're assembling a crack team of creators. Dewby, Prim and Pinkeye.

**4. Products:** 
Punk Avatar World - The Metaverse where you can use your pfp as your avatar.

Punk Avatar Conversion - We'll create a 3D pixelart model of you pfp character.

Punk Avatar Collection - We'll create a punk/pixel art style pfp collection for your project.

Punk Avatar Collection Conversion - We'll import your existing pfp collection.

Punk Avatar Custom Games - We'll design and create a game for your community.

Cribs - It's your home base where you'll find your home in the metaverse. Every Punk will have a place to call home by default. There will be an ever growing list of items you'll be able to add to your home or upgrades for existing items, all available as NFTs.

Core Games List. - Just a few examples for now. Chess, Connect 4, Card Games.

**5. Tokenomics:**
Seeking help on this.

**6. Marketing And Promotion:**
Seeking help but what I know:
We can create our own visual content,jpegs,gifs and videos.
When we have products live that users can try we can encourage posting screenshots. Rewards and prizes could be involved.


My ideas about tokenomics to aid marketing and promotion:
You can stake your coins to earn ETH at a modest rate (below what you'd get staking ETH), also you'll recieve airdropped exclusive nft items and upgrades for use in the metaverse.
The ETH pool will be topped up in an ongoing basis by a percentage of the nft sales. Because this will take some time for the sales to amount to anything I would like to allocate tokens for a prize pool fund in the interim.

The thinking is that the coin will have favourable properties i.e. users have incentives to hold and the coin is not farmed. 
A coin that performs well will find free attention from analysts should be popular among inestors.

**7. Roadmap:**    WIP

After 2 to 3 months you'll be able to login with your metamask wallet and do something basic with your nfts. 


**8. Conclusion:**  WIP
